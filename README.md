simple-select
====================

Simple select to replace `<select>` when need styling it.

Inspired on @blakehaswell gist: https://gist.github.com/blakehaswell/2424807


## TODO
- Use `document.createDocumentFragment` instead `document.createElement`;
- Support to `<optgroup>`;
- Support to `<option value="">` (Currently only `innerHTML` of `<option>` is considered.);
